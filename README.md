1. Project Context
1.1 Background
Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of death globally, accounting for approximately 17.9 million deaths annually according to the World Health Organization. Early detection and accurate prediction of heart disease can significantly improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. This project leverages machine learning, specifically neural networks, to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various medical parameters.
1.2 Problem Statement

•	Provide preliminary heart disease risk assessment 
•	Assist healthcare professionals in making informed decisions 
•	Enable early intervention for high-risk patients 
•	Reduce the burden on healthcare systems 
1.3 Objectives
•	Develop a neural network model for heart disease prediction 
•	Create an interactive system for real-time predictions 
•	Achieve high accuracy in classification tasks 
•	Provide a foundation for future medical AI applications 
1.4 Dataset Overview

•	Age: Patient's age in years 
•	Sex: Gender (1 = male, 0 = female) 
•	CP: Chest pain type (0-3) 
•	Trestbps: Resting blood pressure (mm Hg)
